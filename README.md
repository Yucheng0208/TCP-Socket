# Socket Communication Example

This is a simple client-server socket communication example in Python. It demonstrates communication between a client and a server using TCP/IP sockets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/socket-communication-example.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd socket-communication-example
   ```

3. Run the server:

   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

4. Run the client in a separate terminal or script:

   ```bash
   python client.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the server script to start the server listening on a specified host and port.

2. Run the client script, which connects to the server and allows you to send and receive messages.

3. Enter a string on the client side, and it will be sent to the server. The server responds with a message.

4. The communication continues until you decide to exit.

## Code Explanation

- `server.py`: Contains the server-side code for accepting connections and handling communication.

- `client.py`: Contains the client-side code for connecting to the server and interacting with it.

## Customization

You can customize the host and port settings in both `server.py` and `client.py` according to your requirements.

```python
# Example server customization
python server.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 2000

# Example client customization
python client.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 2000
```
